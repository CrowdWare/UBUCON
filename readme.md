# Motivation
Today we have got Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, WhatsApp and Telegram as platforms to chat and to connect to each other.
All these platforms are collecting data from us and feed us with advertisements, propaganda and they are doing censorchip.
We want a free platform to connect to each other, without beeing disturbed and controled by big brother.  
We want to write private messages without anybody being able to read it.  
We want to see the feeds from all of our friends and not what an algorythm might want to show us.

# Solution
Create a decentral platform p2p (peer two peer).  
No registration needed, so non friends don't see you at all.

We found that [StorJ](https://www.storj.io/) is a good decentraliced platform to store data.
Storj is giving us 150 GB of space for free.  
Imagine that every user has got a 150 GB storage for their newsfeed, pictures and movies and can share this data with friends.  
We only have to store the address (uuid) of our friends in an index file and via this address we have access to the whole data they provide for us.  

We can implement pubs (public hubs) in a regional way.  
So maybe there is a pub in your town and the pub owner provides his storj-space for the community. Then everybody comming to the pub can connect to this pub-space and can list all users registered there.  
Btw...all user data is kept anonymous.  
So, to connect to someone else you have to meet him/her personally first and you have to share addresses (uuid).

If you need more space, because you have got a business running you can rent addional space with StorJ at a low price.

# Plugins
Plugins will make it possible to integrate small tiny apps inside the social platform.

# Indexing / Finding
We will also use #hashtags to find what we want much easier. So we could use it also for dating and finding likeminded people.
Sample: You have got the following tags in your bio: **#lookingForDrummer**, **#guitarPlayer**

So someone else can find you after searching the net for people with the hashtag **#guitarPlayer**
Also drummers can find you searching for **#lookingForDrummer**.


# Neighbourhood
Those solutions can also be used to implement a solution to connect neighbours so that they can share resources and services on a exchanged-logic-free way. So no money will be involved and then we don't have to feed the old system with taxes anymore.
